<p>I am a graduate student at Georgia Tech in Transportation Engineering, currently pursuing a doctorate degree. I work as a research assistant in traffic operations and management group at Tech. I have a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from IIT Bombay.</p>
<p>I am interested in traffic operations and impact analysis. I see traffic as veins in a human body, as a body can't function properly with clogged veins similarly the economic system can't work properly without an efficient transportation system. Here on this platform, I will mainly be discussing disruptive changes happening in the transportation industry and will be giving my two cents on it. Give it a read!</p>
<p>Other than transportation I am also very passionate about education and running. I believe in uplifting underprivileged people and volunteer at fundraising events on a regular basis. </p>
